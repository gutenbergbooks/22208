    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Christopher was a fiddler and a man of genius. Educated people do not deny
      the possibility of such a combination; but it was Christopher&rsquo;s misfortune
      to live amongst a dull and bovine-seeming race, who had little sympathy
      with art and no knowledge of an artist&rsquo;s longings. They contented
      themselves, for the most part, with the belief that Christopher was queer.
      Perhaps he was. My experience of men of genius, limited as it may be,
      points to the fact that oddity is a characteristic of the race. This
      observation is especially true of such of them as are yet unrecognised.
      They wear curious garments and their ways are strange. The outward and
      visible signs of their inward and spiritual graces are familiar to most
      observers of life, and the aesthetic soul recognises the meaning of their
      adornments of the hair and their puttings on of apparel. Genius may be
      said in these cases to be a sort of mental measles exhibited in sartorial
      form, and it may be supposed that but for their breaking out there would
      be some fear of their proving fatal. There are reasons for all things, if
      we could but find them; yet where is the social philosopher who will
      establish the nexus between a passion for Beethoven and the love of a bad
      hat? Why should a man who has perceptions of the beautiful fear the
      barber&rsquo;s shears? There were no social philosophers to speak of in the
      little country town in which Christopher was born and bred, and nobody in
      his case strove to solve these problems. Christopher was established as
      queer, and his townsfolk were disposed to let him rest at that. His pale
      face was remarkable for nothing except a pair of dreamy eyes which could
      at times give sign of inward lightnings. His hair was lank; his figure was
      attenuated and ungraceful; he wore his clothes awkwardly. He was commonly
      supposed to be sulky, and some people thought his tone of voice bumptious
      and insolent. He was far from being a favourite, but those who knew him
      best liked him best, which is a good sign about a man. Everybody was
      compelled to admit that he was a well-conducted young man enough, and on
      Sundays he played the harmonium gratis at the little Independent chapel in
      which that pious and simple pair, his father and mother, had worshipped
      till their last illness. Over this instrument Christopher&mdash;let me
      admit it&mdash;made wonderful eyes, sweeping the ceiling with a glance of
      rapture, and glaring through the boarders at the ladies&rsquo; school (who sat
      in the front of the gallery) with orbs which seemed to see not. The young
      ladies were a little afraid of him, and his pallor and loneliness, and the
      very reputation he had for oddity, enlisted the sympathies of some of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever tender flutterings might disturb the bosoms of the young ladies
      in the galleries, Christopher cared not. His heart was fixed on Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara, who surely deserves a paragraph to herself, was provokingly
      pretty, to begin with, and she had a fascinating natural way which made
      young men and young women alike unhappy. She bubbled over&mdash;pardon
      this kitchen simile&mdash;with unaffected gaiety; she charmed, she
      bewitched, she delighted, she made angry and bewitched again. The young
      ladies very naturally saw nothing in her, but a certain pert forwardness
      of which themselves would not be guilty, though it should bring a world of
      young gentlemen sighing to their feet. Barbara was nineteen, and she had a
      voice which for gaiety and sweetness was like that of a throstle.
      Christopher had himself taught her to sing. His own voice was cacophonous
      and funereal, and it was droll to hear him solemnly phrasing &lsquo;I will
      enchant thine ear&rsquo; for the instruction of his enchantress. But he was a
      good master, and Barbara prospered under him, and added a professional
      finish and exactness to her natural graces. She lived alone with an old
      uncle who had sold everything to buy an annuity, and she had no
      expectations from anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher had no expectations either, except of a stiff struggle with
      the world, but the two young people loved each other, and, having their
      choice of proverbs, they discarded the one which relates to poverty and a
      door and love and a window, and selected for their own guidance that
      cheerful saying which sets forth the belief that what is enough for one is
      enough for two. Christopher, therefore, bent himself like a man to earn
      enough for one, and up to the time of the beginning of this history had
      achieved a qualified failure. Barbara believed in his genius, but so far
      nobody else did, and the look-out was not altogether cheerful. Barbara&rsquo;s
      surname was Allen, but her godfathers and godmothers at her baptism had
      been actuated by no reminiscences of ballad poetry, and she was called
      Barbara because her godmother was called Barbara and was ready to present
      her with a silver caudle-cup on condition that the baby bore her name.
      Christopher knew the sweet and quaint old ballad, and introduced it to his
      love, who was charmed to discover herself like-named with a heroine of
      fiction. She used to sing it to him in private, and sometimes to her
      uncle, but it was exclusively a home song. Christopher made a violin
      setting of it which Barbara used to accompany on the pianoforte, a setting
      in which the poor old song was tortured into wild cadenzas and dizzy
      cataracts of caterwauling after the approved Italian manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days went by, days that were halcyon under love&rsquo;s own sunshine. What
      matter if the mere skies were clouded, the mere material sun shut out, the
      wind bitter? Love can build a shelter for his votaries, and has a
      sun-shine of his own. Still let me sing thy praises, gracious Love, though
      I am entering on the days of fogeydom, and my minstrelsy is something
      rusty. I remember; I remember. Thou and I have heard the chimes at
      midnight, melancholy sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Barbara,&rsquo; said Christopher, one evening, bending his mournful brows above
      her, &lsquo;we must part.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; said Barbara smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no hope of doing anything here,&rsquo; continued Christopher. &lsquo;I must
      face the world, and if there is anything in me, I must force the world to
      see it and to own it. I am going up to London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To London?&rsquo; asked Barbara, no longer smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To London,&rsquo; said Christopher, quoting Mrs. Browning; &lsquo;to the
      gathering-place of souls.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What shall you do there, Christopher?&rsquo; asked Barbara, by this time
      tremulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall take my compositions with me,&rsquo; he answered,&rsquo; and offer them to
      the publishers. I will find out the people who give concerts and get leave
      to play. I will play at first for nothing: I can but try. If I fail, I
      fail. But there is nothing here to work upon. There is no knowledge of art
      and no love for it. I must have more elbow-room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elbow-room is indispensable to a violinist, and Barbara was compelled to
      agree to her lover&rsquo;s programme. She was a brave little creature, and
      though she was as sorry to part with her lover as even he could wish her,
      she accepted the inevitable. Christopher finished his quarter&rsquo;s
      instructions where he had pupils, declined such few further engagements as
      offered themselves, packed up his belongings in a tin box somewhat too
      large for them, said farewell, and went his way to London. Barbara went
      with him by coach into the great neighbouring town five miles away, and
      saw him off by train. The times and the place where these two were bred
      were alike primitive, and this farewell journey had no shadow of
      impropriety in it even for the most censorious eyes. The coach did not
      return till evening, and little Barbara had three or four hours on her
      hands. She walked disconsolately from the station, with her veil down to
      hide the few tears which forced themselves past her resolution. Scarcely
      noticing whither her feet carried her, she had wandered into a retired and
      dusty street which bore plainly upon its surface the unwritten but
      readable announcement of genteel poverty, and there in a parlour window
      was a largeish placard bearing this legend: &lsquo;Mrs. Lochleven Cameron
      prepares pupils for the Stage. Enquire Within.&rsquo; A sudden inspiration
      entered Barbara&rsquo;s heart. She had seen the inside of a theatre once or
      twice, and she thought herself prettier and knew she could sing better
      than the singing chambermaid whom everybody had so applauded. Christopher
      had often defended the stage from the aspersions cast upon it by the
      ignorant prejudices of country-bred folk, who looked on the theatre as a
      device of the Arch-Enemy and an avenue to his halls of darkness. In pious
      varyings from church she had heard the Eeverend Paul Screed compare the
      theatrical pit with that other pit of which the Enemy holds perpetual
      lease, but she respected Christopher&rsquo;s opinion more highly than that of
      the Eeverend Paul. There was yet a sense of wickedness in the thought
      which assailed her, and her heart beat violently as she ascended the steps
      which led to Mrs. Lochleven Cameron&rsquo;s door. She dried her eyes, summoned
      her resolution, and rang the bell. A pale-faced lady of stately carriage
      opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish,&rsquo; said little Barbara, with a beating heart, &lsquo;to see Mrs.
      Cameron.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray enter,&rsquo; returned the lady in tones so deep that she might have been
      a gentleman in disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara entered, and the deep-voiced lady closed the door, and led the way
      into a scantily furnished parlour, which held, amongst other objects, a
      rickety-looking grand piano of ancient make.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be seated,&rsquo; said the deep-voiced lady. &lsquo;I am Mrs. Lochleven Cameron. What
      are your wishes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was just a suspicion of Dublin in Mrs. Cameron&rsquo;s rich and rolling
      tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You prepare pupils for the stage?&rsquo; said Barbara. Her own clear and sweet
      voice sounded strange to her, as though it belonged to somebody else, but
      she spoke with outward calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you wish to take lessons?&rsquo; asked the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I can afford to pay your terms,&rsquo; said little Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What can you do?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Cameron with stage solemnity. &lsquo;Have you had
      any practice? Can you sing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not know what I can do,&rsquo; said Barbara. &lsquo;I can sing a little.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me hear you,&rsquo; said the deep voice; and the lady, with a regal
      gesture, threw open the grand piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara drew off her thread gloves and lifted her veil, and then, sitting
      down to the piano, sang the piteous ballad of the Four Marys. Barbara knew
      nothing of the easy emotions of people of the stage, and she was almost
      frightened when, looking up timidly at the conclusion of the song, she saw
      that Mrs. Cameron was crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait here a time, my dear,&rsquo; said Mrs. Lochleven Cameron, regally
      business-like in spite of her tears, but with the suggestion of Dublin a
      trifle more developed in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She swept from the room, and closed the door behind her; and Barbara, not
      yet rid of the feeling that she was somebody else, heard Mrs. Cameron&rsquo;s
      voice, somewhat subdued, calling &lsquo;Joe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; asked another deep voice, wherein the influences of Dublin
      and the stage together struggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come down,&rsquo; said Mrs. Cameron; and in answer to this summons a solemn
      footstep was heard upon the stair. Barbara heard the sound of a whispered
      conference outside, and then, the door being opened, Mrs. Cameron ushered
      in a gentleman tall and lank and sombre, like Mrs. Cameron, he was very
      pale, but in his case the pallor of his cheeks was intensified by the
      blackness of his hair and the purple-black bloom upon his chin and upper
      lip. He looked to Barbara like an undertaker who mourned the stagnation of
      trade. To you or me he would have looked like what he was, a second or
      third-rate tragedian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not yet the pleasure of your name,&rsquo; said Mrs. Lochleven Cameron,
      addressing Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name is Barbara Allen,&rsquo; said Barbara, speaking it unconsciously as
      though it were a line of an old ballad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This, Miss Allen,&rsquo; said Mrs. Cameron with a sweep of the right hand which
      might have served to introduce a landscape, &lsquo;is Mr. Lochleven Cameron.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara rose and curtsied, and Mr. Lochleven Cameron bowed. Barbara
      concluded that this was <i>not</i> the gentleman who had been called
      downstairs as &lsquo;Joe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you&rsquo; sing that little ballad over again, Miss Allen?&rsquo; asked Mrs.
      Cameron, gravely seating herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara sang the ballad over again, and sang it rather better than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cameron cried again, and Mr. Cameron said &lsquo;Bravo!&rsquo; at the finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Mrs. Cameron, &lsquo;do you know anything sprightly?&rsquo; she pronounced
      it &lsquo;sproightly,&rsquo; but she was off her guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara, by this time only enough excited to do her best, sang &lsquo;Come
      lasses and lads,&rsquo; and sang it like herself, with honest mirth and rural
      roguishness. For without knowing it, this young lady was a born actress,
      and did by nature and beautifully what others are taught to do awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have to broaden the style a little for the theatre,&rsquo; said the
      tragédienne, &lsquo;but for a small room nothing could be better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I venture to predict,&rsquo; said the tragedian, &lsquo;that Miss Allen will become
      an ornament to the profession.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid,&rsquo; said Barbara, rising from the piano, &lsquo;that after all I may
      be only wasting your time. I have not asked your terms, and&mdash;I am&mdash;I
      have not much money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Allen,&rsquo; said the tragedian, &lsquo;unless I am much mistaken, you will not
      long have to mourn that unpleasant condition of affairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are your parents aware of your design, Miss Allen?&rsquo; This from the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no parents,&rsquo; faltered Barbara. &lsquo;I am living with my uncle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does he know your wishes in this matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Barbara, and the feeling of guilt returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he is willing to entrust you to my tuition,&rsquo; said Mrs. Lochleven
      Cameron, &lsquo;I should be willing to instruct you without charge on condition
      that you bound yourself to pay to Mr. Cameron one-third of your earnings
      for the first three years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This opened up a vista to Barbara, but she was certain that her uncle
      would give his consent to no such arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better lay the matter before your uncle, Miss Allen,&rsquo; said the
      tragedian. &lsquo;Without his consent, Mrs. Lochleven Cameron could not see her
      way to an arrangement. She is; aware&mdash;as I am&mdash;of the undeserved
      stigma which has been cast upon the profession by bigotry and ignorance.
      She has no respect for the prejudice&mdash;nor have I&mdash;but she will
      not violate the feelings of those who are so unfortunate as to suffer
      under it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye&rsquo;re quite right, Joe,&rsquo; said Mrs. Cameron colloquially, and then, with
      added grandeur, to Barbara, &lsquo;Mr. Lochleven Cameron expresses me own
      feelings admirably.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara made no reply. It would have been sweet to work for Christopher
      even by so audacious a means as going on the stage. But the vision
      crumbled when she thought of her uncle. She dropped her veil and drew on
      her gloves slowly, and as she did so a rapid step ascended to the front
      door, there came the click of a latch-key, the slam of the street door as
      it closed, and then, with an imperative knock which awaited no answer, a
      young man rushed into the room and shouted,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Done at last!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was triumph in this young man&rsquo;s eyes, and the flush of triumph on
      his cheek. He was a handsome young fellow of perhaps five-and-twenty, with
      a light curling beard and a great blonde moustache. His clothes were a
      little seedy, but he looked like a gentleman. He did not notice Barbara,
      and the tragedian and his wife apparently forgot her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?&rsquo; began Mrs. Lochleven
    </p>
    <p>
      Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I do mean it,&rsquo; cried the new-comer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rackstraw has taken it. It is to be put in rehearsal on Monday, and
      billed for Monday-week. How&rsquo;s that for high, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good, dear boy, good!&rsquo; said the tragedian, and the two shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But that&rsquo;s not all,&rsquo; said the new-comer. &lsquo;Milford was there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The London Milford?&rsquo; asked Mr. Cameron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The London Milford,&rsquo; said the other. &lsquo;Milford of the Garrick. He heard me
      read it, prophesied a great run for it, has promised to come down again
      and see it, and if it fulfils his hopes of it, means to take it up to
      town. In fact, it&rsquo;s as good as settled.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I congratulate ye, me boy,&rsquo; said Mr. Cameron. &lsquo;I knew ye&rsquo;d hit &lsquo;em one of
      these fine days. I knew ut.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Through all this, which she only half understood, Barbara was silent. She
      took advantage of the lull which followed the tragedian&rsquo;s expression of
      friendly triumph to recall Mrs. Cameron to the knowledge of her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will speak to my uncle,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and I will write to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger looked round when she spoke, and snatched his hat off.
      Barbara bent her head in general salutation and went her way. When she
      left the street, she could scarcely believe that it had not all been a
      dream. It was so unlike herself to do anything so bold-She felt more and
      more guilty as she waited for the coach, more and more afraid of confiding
      to her uncle such a scheme as that she had so hastily formed. When she
      reached home she made one or two inward overtures towards the attempt, but
      her courage failed her, and she kept silence. Yet she used to think
      sometimes that if she had the power to shorten poor Christopher&rsquo;s
      struggles, it was almost a crime not to do it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We who live in London know well enough that its streets are not paved with
      gold. If one had asked Christopher his opinion on that point, he would no
      doubt have laughed at the childishness of the question, yet he came up to
      London with all the confidence and certainty which the old childish belief
      could have inspired. He was coming to make his fortune. That went without
      saying. He was brim-full of belief in himself, to begin with. &lsquo;The world&rsquo;s
      mine oyster,&rsquo; he thought, as the cheap parliamentary train crawled from
      station to station. The world is <i>my</i> oyster, for that matter, but
      the edible mollusc is hidden, and the shell is uninviting. Christopher
      found the mollusc very shy, the shell innutritive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Publishers did not leap at the organ fugue in C as they ought to have
      done. They skipped not in answer to the adagio movement in the May-day
      Symphony. The oratorio conjured no money from their pockets&mdash;for the
      most part, they declined to open the wrapper which surrounded it, or to
      see it opened. Poor Christopher, in short, experienced all the scorn which
      patient merit of the unworthy takes, and found his own appreciation of
      himself of little help to him. His money melted&mdash;as money has a knack
      of melting when one would least wish to see it melt. Oxford Street became
      to him as stony-hearted a step-mother as it was to De Quincey, and at
      melancholy last&mdash;while his letters to Barbara became shorter and
      fewer&mdash;he found an enforced way to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s, whither went all
      which his Uncle&rsquo;s capacious maw would receive; all, except the beloved
      violin which had so often sung to Barbara, so often sounded Love&rsquo;s sweet
      lullaby in the quiet of his own chamber. <i>That</i> he could not part
      with, for he was a true enthusiast when all was told. So he went about
      hungry for a day or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have hurried a little in telling his story in order that I might get the
      worst over at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months before he came to this sad pass he was standing one cold night
      in front of the Euston Road entrance to the great terminal station, when
      the sound of a violin struck upon his ears, played as surely a violin was
      never played in the streets before. The performer, whoever he might be,
      slashed away with a wonderful merry abandonment, playing the jolliest
      tunes, until he had a great crowd about him, on the outskirts of which
      girls with their arms embracing each other swung round in time to the
      measured madness of the music. The close-pent crowd beat time with hand
      and foot, and sometimes this rude accompaniment almost drowned the music:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      An Orpheus! An Orpheus! He worked on the crowd; He swayed them with melody
      merry and loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people went half wild over this street Paganini. They laughed with him
      and danced to his music until their rough acclamation almost made the
      music dumb. Then suddenly he changed his theme, and the sparkle went out
      of the air and left it dim and foggy as it was by nature, and by-and-by
      added a deeper gloom to it. For he played a ghostly and weird and awful
      theme, which stilled merriment and chilled jollity, and seemed to fill the
      night with phantoms. It made a very singular impression indeed upon
      Christopher&rsquo;s! nerves. Christopher was not so well nourished as he might
      have been, and when a man&rsquo;s economy plays tricks with his stomach, the
      stomach is likely to pass the trick on with interest. He stood amazed&mdash;doubtful
      of his ears, of the street, of the people, of his own identity. For that
      weird and awful theme was his own, and, which made the thing more
      wonderful, he had never even written it down. And here was somebody
      playing it note for note, a lengthy and intricate composition which set
      all theory of coincidence utterly aside. Nobody need wonder at
      Christopher&rsquo;s amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The street fiddler played the theme clean out, and then passed through the
      crowd in search of coppers. It furnished a lesson worth his learning that,
      while he abandoned himself to mirth, the coppers had showered into the hat
      at his feet in tinkling accompaniment to his strains; and that now the
      weird and mournful theme had sealed generosity&rsquo;s fountain as with sudden
      frost. The musician came at last, hat in hand, to Christopher. He was a
      queer figure. His hair was long and matted, his eyes were obscured by a
      pair of large spectacles of darkened glass, and his coat collar was turned
      up to the tops of his ears. A neglected-looking beard jutted out from the
      opening in the collar, and not a feature but the man&rsquo;s nose was visible.
      The crowd had gone; looking round, one could scarcely have suspected that
      the crowd had been there at all a minute before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was a curious theme you played last of all,&rsquo; said Christopher. &lsquo;Was
      it your own?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the musician, chinking together the coppers in his felt hat as
      a reminder of the more immediate business in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whose was it?&rsquo; asked Christopher, ignoring the hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; the musician answered shortly, and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nobody left to appeal to, so, putting his fiddle and bow under
      his arm, he emptied the coppers into his trousers&rsquo; pockets, and, putting
      on his hat, made away in the direction of King&rsquo;s Cross. Christopher
      followed at a little distance, wonder-stricken still, and half disposed to
      return to the charge again. The musician, reaching the corner of Gray&rsquo;s
      Inn Road, turned. This was Christopher&rsquo;s homeward way, and he followed.
      By-and-by the fiddler made a turn to the right. This was still
      Christopher&rsquo;s homeward way, and still he followed. By-and-by the man
      stopped before a door and produced a latch-key. The house before which he
      stood was that in which Christopher lodged. He laid a hand upon the
      fiddler&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you live here?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What has that to do with you?&rsquo; retorted the fiddler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was my theme you played,&rsquo; said Christopher; &lsquo;and if you live here, I
      know how you got hold of it. You have heard me play it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You live on the third floor?&rsquo; said the other in a changed tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m in the attics, worse luck to me,&rsquo; said the street player. &lsquo;Come into
      my room, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door and went upstairs in the darkness, with the assured
      step of custom. Christopher, less used to the house, blundered slowly
      upwards after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait a minute,&rsquo; said the occupant of the attic, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll get a light.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little pause, and then came the splutter of a match. The pale
      glow of a single candle lit the room dimly. Christopher jumped at the
      sight of a third man in the room. No! There were but two people there. But
      where, then, was the man who had led him hither? Here before him was a
      merry-looking youngster of perhaps two-and-twenty, with a light brown
      moustache and eyes grey or blue, and close-cropped fair hair. The hirsute
      and uncombed genius of the street had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t stare like that, sir,&rsquo; said the transformed comically. &lsquo;Here are
      the props.&rsquo; He held up a ragged wig and beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The what?&rsquo; asked Christopher. &lsquo;The props,&rsquo; returned the other. &lsquo;Props are
      properties. Properties are theatrical belongings. There&rsquo;s nothing
      diabolical or supernatural about it. Wait a minute, and I&rsquo;ll light the
      lamp and set the fire going.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher stood in silence whilst his new acquaintance bustled about the
      room. The lamp cast a full and mellow light over the whole apartment, and
      the fire began to crackle and leap merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit down,&rsquo; said the host, and Christopher obeyed. &lsquo;I always like to take
      the bull by the horns,&rsquo; the host continued with a little blush. &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      want to be found out at this game, but you have found me out, and so I
      make the best of it, and throw myself upon your confidence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up the wig and beard lightly between his finger and thumb and
      dropped them again, laughing and blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may rely upon me,&rsquo; said Christopher in his own dogged and sulky
      tones. &lsquo;If I wanted to tell of it, I know nobody in London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was your theme, was it?&rsquo; said the host, throwing one leg over the
      other and nursing it with both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Christopher; &lsquo;you played it very accurately, you must have a
      very fine memory.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose I have,&rsquo; said the other, with a little laugh. &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s a
      wonderful thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think so?&rsquo; asked Christopher, blushing with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do indeed,&rsquo; his new acquaintance answered. &lsquo;Play something else of
      yours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a bed in one corner of the room, and on this he had laid the
      instrument and the bow when he came in. He arose now and proffered them to
      Christopher. Christopher took them from his outstretched hand and played.
      The other listened, nursing his leg again, and nodding at the fire, in
      time to the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You write better than you play,&rsquo; he said at length, with more candour
      than was altogether agreeable. &lsquo;Not that your playing isn&rsquo;t good, but it
      misses&mdash;just misses&mdash;the real grip&mdash;the real royal thing.
      Only one player in a million has it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think you have it?&rsquo; asked Christopher, not sneeringly, though the
      words might imply a sneer, but speaking because he was shy and felt bound
      to say something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I?&rsquo; said the other, with a merry laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O Lord no! A man can&rsquo;t bring out more than there is in him. There&rsquo;s no
      divine melody in <i>me</i>. Good spirits now and then, a bit of sentiment
      now and then, a dash more or less of the devil now and then&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all I&rsquo;m equal to. If I could have written that gavotte you played a minute
      ago, I could knock sparks out of people with it. Here! lend me the
      fiddle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He played it through with the grave-faced merriment proper to it, and here
      and there with such a frolicking forth of sudden laughter and innocent fun
      as gave gravity the lie and made the pretence of it dearly droll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rsquo; he said, looking up with naïve triumph when he had finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that was it, Christopher confessed, as he took back the violin and
      bow and laid them on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What brings a man who plays as you do, playing in the streets?&rsquo; he asked
      a little sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That eternal want of pence which vexes fiddlers,&rsquo; said the youngster &lsquo;I
      lost an engagement a month ago. First violin at the Garrick. Rowed with
      the manager. Nothing else turned up. Must make money somehow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you made to-night?&rsquo; Christopher asked. &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; he
      said a second later; &lsquo;that is no business of mine, of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About seven or eight shillings,&rsquo; said the other, disregarding the
      withdrawal of the question. &lsquo;And I won&rsquo;t ask you,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;what
      brings a man who writes like you living near the clouds in a street like
      this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you an Englishman?&rsquo; asked Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the other. &lsquo;No fiddler ever was. I beg your pardon. I oughtn&rsquo;t
      to have said that, even though I think it. No. I am a Bohemian, blood and
      bones, but I came to England when I was eight years old, and I have lived
      in London ever since.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They went on talking together, and laid the foundations of a friendship
      which afterwards built itself up steadily. In two months&rsquo; time Carl Rubach
      was restored to his old place at the Garrick, and poor Christopher was
      beginning to find out in real earnest what it was to be hungry. He was too
      proud to ask anybody for a loan, and Rubach was the only man he really
      knew. &lsquo;When things are at their worst,&rsquo; says the cynical bard, &lsquo;they
      sometimes mend.&rsquo; Things suddenly mended for Christopher. The Bohemian
      turned up one afternoon with an Englishman in his train, a handsome young
      fellow of perhaps five-and-twenty, with a light curling beard and a blonde
      moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Allow me to introduce to you Mr. John Holt,&rsquo; said the Bohemian. &lsquo;This,
      Mr. Holt, is Mr. Christopher Stretton, a musician of great genius. This&mdash;Stretton&mdash;is
      Mr. John Holt, a dramatist of great power. Gentlemen, know each other. Mr.
      Holt writes charming songs. Mr. Stretton writes beautiful music.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He flourished with mock gravity as he said these things, turning first to
      one and then to the other. Mr. John Holt&rsquo;s eyes were keen and observant;
      and one swift glance took in the knowledge of the composer&rsquo;s hungry
      pallor, his threadbare dress, the bare and poverty-stricken aspect of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have two songs for a new play of mine,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I want them set to
      music.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher&rsquo;s hand, thinner and more transparent than a healthy man&rsquo;s hand
      should be, reached out for the offered manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When do you think you can let me have the music?&rsquo; asked the dramatist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher read the songs through, and looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So soon!&rsquo; said the other. &lsquo;At what time to-morrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will midday suit you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you bring them to that address?&rsquo; &lsquo;I will be there,&rsquo; responded
      Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      His visitors left him and he sat down to think. He was weak, and the pains
      of hunger gnawed him, but as he sat over one of the songs the words built
      themselves into a tune almost without his knowledge or effort. Then he
      turned to write, and found that he had no music-paper. He laughed bitterly
      at this discovery, and looking round the bare apartment sighted his
      violin-case, and rising, took the violin and bow out of it, put on his
      hat, and, with the case under his arm, made for the pawnbroker&rsquo;s. There he
      realised half-a-crown, one halfpenny of which was confiscated in payment
      for the pawn-ticket. He bought paper and pen and ink, and having taken
      them home, went out again and ate cold sausage at the bar of a
      public-house, and came back with a few pence still in his pockets. There
      was a nausea upon him, and he could not recall the air he wished to write.
      He had eaten nothing for three days and he felt at once sick and drowsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was fain to lie down, and he fell asleep, to awake in two hours&rsquo; time a
      little strengthened and refreshed. The tune came back again, and he set it
      down, and then attacked the second one with like success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning came, and after a meagre breakfast which finished his resources,
      he went weakly to the address the dramatist had given him. Mr. Holt had
      left behind him apologies for unavoidable absence. Would Mr. Stretton call
      again at three? He wandered desolately home, and; waited, and when the
      time drew near set out again. This time the dramatist was ready to:
      receive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The lady who will sing the songs is here,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and with your
      permission I will ask her to try them over now. Will you come with me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would rather await you here,&rsquo; said Christopher. The tunes he had
      written were running riot in his head, and he thought them puerile,
      vulgar, shameful. He would have torn the papers on which they were written
      if he had not already surrendered them. He had liked them an hour ago, and
      now he thought them detestable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you please,&rsquo; said the dramatist, and added &lsquo;poor beggar!&rsquo; inwardly as
      he went upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The composer sat in a sick half-dream and faintly heard a piano sounding
      in a distant room. It played the prelude of one of his songs. Now and then
      the sound of a female voice just touched his ears. He was so fatigued and
      weak that, in spite of his anxiety, he glided into a troubled doze in
      which he dreamed of Barbara. The dramatist returned, and Christopher came
      back to the daylight at the sound of the opening door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mademoiselle Hélène and myself,&rsquo; said Mr. Holt, &lsquo;are alike delighted with
      your setting of the songs. I shall ask you, Mr. Stretton, to read my
      comedy and to write the whole of the incidental music, if you will accept
      the commission. We can talk over terms afterwards. In the mean time, shall
      I offer you a cheque for ten guineas?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Christopher. He took the cheque and walked to the bank,
      which was near at hand in Pall Mall, received his money, and plunged into
      an eating-house, whence he emerged intoxicated by the absorption of a cup
      of coffee and a steak. If you doubt the physical accuracy of that
      statement, pray reduce yourself to Christopher&rsquo;s condition and try the
      experiment. You are respectfully assured that you will doubt no longer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Christopher wrote the incidental music for the new comedy and composed an
      overture and entr&rsquo;actes for it&mdash;work for which he was paid pretty
      liberally. He wrote to Barbara of his better fortunes, and promised to run
      down and see her so soon as the business strain was over. But the business
      strain was over and he did not go. He finished his music, rehearsed it
      once with the orchestra of the Garrick Theatre, and then fell ill of a low
      fever through which Rubach most kindly nursed him. The Bohemian himself
      was busy, rehearsing half the day and playing at the theatre at night, but
      he gave all his spare time to his friend. I had forgotten to tell you
      that, for convenience&rsquo; sake, they had quitted their old lodgings, and had
      taken chambers off the Strand, within three minutes&rsquo; easy walk of the
      house. It was here that Christopher fell ill.

    <p>
      When he grew a little better, the Bohemian rather began to aggravate him.
      Rubach talked of the new piece and its heroine, and of nothing but the new
      piece and its heroine. He was enraptured with her. He confessed himself
      overhead in love. So charming, so dainty, so sweet, so piquante, so
      lovable was Mademoiselle Hélène. Rubach, half in earnest, half in jest,
      confessed himself hopeless. Mademoiselle was engaged to Mr. Holt the
      dramatist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And even if she were not,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;is it likely she would look at a
      poor wretch of a fiddler? She is going to make her fortune. She is going
      to be the rage. She has never played before, but she sings like a lark,
      like a linnet, like a nightingale; and she walks the boards as naturally
      as if she had been born upon them. She is English too, in spite of her
      foreign name. Why on earth do professional English people take foreign
      names?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; said Christopher wearily. &lsquo;I should like to go
      to sleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While the sick man slept or made believe to sleep, Rubach was quiet as a
      mouse; but when he awoke the ecstatic praises began again, until, before
      the public knew more of the new actress than her name, our poor invalid
      was sick of her and of her praises to the very soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried, however, to take some interest in the piece, and as he became
      stronger he began to grow a little anxious about his own share in its
      success. When the eventful night came he was able to sit up for an hour
      before the piece began, and Rubach had to leave him. It was midnight
      before the faithful chum returned, and after looking in on the invalid,
      who seemed to slumber calmly, sat down for a final pipe by his own
      bedside. But Christopher was only &lsquo;playing &lsquo;possum,&rsquo; as our playful
      American cousins put it, and, his anxiety over-riding his desire for
      quiet, he called out,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that you, Carl?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the other, hastening into his room on tiptoe. &lsquo;I thought you
      were asleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did the music go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Capitally. Both the songs repeated. The overture and the second entr&rsquo;acte
      would have been redemanded at a concert, but of course the play was the
      thing. Such a success, Stretton! Such a furore! She is a little goddess, a
      queen. You should see her and hear her! Ah me!&rsquo;&mdash;with a comic
      ruefulness&mdash;&lsquo;Holt should be a happy man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher, warned by his outbreak, which he knew by old experience to be
      the merest exordium, &lsquo;played &lsquo;possum&rsquo; again, with such success that Rubach
      left him and he went to sleep in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holt came to see him next day, and brought the morning papers with him.
      The musician and he began to talk about writing an English opera together,
      and Christopher brightened at the scheme, which opened up the road to all
      his old ambitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are getting stronger now,&rsquo; said Holt. &lsquo;We shall have you in to see
      the piece by-and-by.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall come in a day or two,&rsquo; said Christopher; and when his visitor had
      gone, sat down to read over and over again the reviews of his own work.
      How they would gladden Barbara, he thought. How proud she would be of his
      success! how eager to hear the music! He laid-a romantic little plot for
      her pleasure. He would run down when he got stronger, and compel Barbara
      and her uncle on a visit to town. He would convey them to the theatre and
      when Barbara was quite in love with the music he would tell her that he
      himself had written it. How well the songs would suit her voice, and how
      charmingly she would sing them to him! Pleasant fancies, such as lovers
      have, floated through his mind. He took up his violin for the first time
      for a month, and played through the old tune, &lsquo;Cruel Barbara Allen.&rsquo; 
      Rubach came in and found him thus employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are getting on, my boy,&rsquo; said the good Bohemian. &lsquo;Can you come and
      see the piece to-night? Are you strong enough?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not to-night,&rsquo; Christopher returned. &lsquo;In a day or two.&rsquo; And he went oh
      playing &lsquo;Cruel &lsquo;Barbara Allen&rsquo; dreamily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is that?&rsquo; said Rubach with a wry grin. &lsquo;Is not twice or thrice of it
      enough?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher laid down the instrument with a smile. When Carl had left him
      he took it up again and played over to himself the songs Barbara used to
      sing. He was weak and could not play for any great length of time
      together, but he played every now and then a melody, and in a while he got
      back again to &lsquo;Cruel Barbara Allen.&rsquo; Back came Carl as he played it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That tune again? what is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An old ballad,&rsquo; answered Christopher. &ldquo;Cruel Barbara Allen.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He found a pleasure in speaking her name aloud in this veiled way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let the girl alone,&rsquo; said Carl. &lsquo;I am tired of her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not,&rsquo; said Christopher with a weak little chuckle, &lsquo;and I have known
      her since she was a child.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to play the air again, and Carl took away the violin with
      simulated theatric anger. But Carl&rsquo;s treatment of the name of the ballad
      as though it were the name of a girl still extant gave Christopher a
      temptation, and he played the air once or twice again in Carl&rsquo;s presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are passionately attached to Miss Allen,&rsquo; said Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is the only sweetheart I ever had, responded simple Christopher with
      shy merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rubach sat down at the piano and sang this song:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Through all the green glad summer-time
     Love told his tale in dainty rhyme,
        And sighed his loves out one by one,
     There lives no echo of his laugh,
     I but record his epitaph,
        And sigh for love worn out and gone.

     For love endures for little time,
     But dies with every change of rhyme,
        And lives again with every one.
     And every new-born love doth laugh
     Above his brother&rsquo;s epitaph,
        The last light love worn out and gone.
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is not your doctrine, mon ami,&rsquo; he said as he turned round on the
      music-stool. &lsquo;You are faithful to Miss Allen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am faithful to Miss Allen, certainly,&rsquo; said Christopher, reaching out
      his hand for the violin, and again chuckling weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Carl, rising and confiscating the fiddle. &lsquo;You shall sing her
      virtues to that tune no more. Write a new tune for her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anybody who has been in love, and I do not care for any other sort of
      reader, may fancy for himself the peculiar enjoyment which shy Christopher
      extracted from this homely badinage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three days later he was almost reestablished, and had indeed begun
      to write a little. He would not yet go to the theatre, however, having
      some fear of the excitement. He sat alone in the sitting-room which he and
      his chum occupied in common, dreaming of Barbara over a book, and building
      cloud palaces. It was ten o&rsquo;clock in the evening, and Carl would not be
      home till midnight. Then &lsquo;who was this dashing tumultuously up the stone
      steps after Carl&rsquo;s accustomed fashion? Carl himself, it seemed, but unlike
      himself, pale and breathless, and with an ugly scratch across his forehead
      which looked at first sight like a severe wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; cried Christopher, rising hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have had a fall,&rsquo; said Carl. &lsquo;There is nothing to be alarmed at, but,&rsquo; 
      holding out his left hand, &lsquo;I have sprained my wrist and I cannot play.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did it happen?&rsquo; asked Christopher, following him into the bedroom,
      where Carl had already begun to twine a wet handkerchief round the injured
      wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was crossing the stage between the acts,&rsquo; said Carl; &lsquo;a plank had been
      moved, and I set my foot in the hole and fell&mdash;voilà tout I want to
      ask you to play for me. There is not a man in the band who can do justice
      to &ldquo;When Love has flown.&rdquo; It will be no trouble to you. You will simply
      have to stand in the flies and play the air whilst a man on the stage
      appears to play it, sawing away with a soaped bow. Will you come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher stood irresolute. &lsquo;They can do without me in the orchestra,&rsquo; 
      said Carl, &lsquo;but I have been playing your song as it deserves to be played.
      Mademoiselle Hélène looks forward to its being played so. It gives her
      aid, I know. The people look to hear it well played, and if you do not go
      it will be given to Jones&mdash;to Jones, Gott in Himmel! who plays as a
      mason cuts stone. Do come. It will cost you no trouble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher took up his violin-case, long since extracted from My Uncle&rsquo;s
      maw, and followed Carl from the chambers into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You play only the first movement, very low and soft,&rsquo; said Carl as they
      went along. &lsquo;I will stand by you and tell you when to begin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the theatre&mdash;a terra incognita to Christopher&mdash;and
      found their way through a chaos of disused dusty scenery. A great burst of
      applause sounded through the unseen house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is for Mademoiselle,&rsquo; said Carl, &lsquo;We are just in time to get breath
      comfortably. Stay here. I will be with you directly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He left Christopher standing in the flies, looking on the stage. There
      were two or three people on the boards, but Christopher had not the key to
      their talk, and had little interest in them. By-and-by all but one left
      the stage. The light dwindled and faded. The sun-sets on the English stage
      are as rapid as in any tropic region. The player played his part. He was
      in love, and true as true could be, but the empress of his soul had her
      doubts about him. How could she doubt him? That was the burden of his
      speech as he sat at the table, and murmured the loved one&rsquo;s cruelty with a
      broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit. It
      was almost dark when the first rays of the silver moon fell athwart the
      chamber. Christopher felt that the dead silence of the house betokened the
      coming of the crisis in the play, and he was strung to the expectation of
      something out of the common. Watching from his own dark standing-place, he
      could see the actor draw towards him a violin case, and he silently drew
      forth his own instrument to be in readiness. Whilst he waited and watched,
      Carl&rsquo;s stealthy footstep sounded behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will see her in a minute or two,&rsquo; whispered Carl. &lsquo;I will touch you
      once, when you shall make ready, and once when you shall begin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For half a minute or nearly, everything was still on the stage and in the
      house. Then the player&rsquo;s voice, passionate and low, broke again upon the
      silence, and in a second or two Carl touched Christopher upon the
      shoulder. There was a curiously <i>crisp</i> feeling in the-composer&rsquo;s
      nerves, and he was a little excited. He tucked his violin under his chin,
      and stood prepared. Into the definite band of moonlight which crossed the
      stage glided suddenly a white figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; whispered Carl, and touched the musician on the shoulder, and
      straight from the violin soared a voice, not soft and low, but clear and
      loud, and the air was &lsquo;Cruel Barbara Allen.&rsquo; Carl fell back a step or two
      in his amazement. The white figure on the stage turned round, and for a
      moment peered into the darkness of the flies&mdash;then glided on again.
      The air once played, the composer cast his violin upon the stage beneath
      his feet and trampled it, hurled the bow from him, and with one cry,
      eloquent of agony and rage, turned and dashed past his companion, and,
      tumbling through the dark and unaccustomed ways, reached the street. Carl
      followed him and caught him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it, Stretton? What is the matter?&rsquo; he cried, and seized his
      friend by the arm. Christopher answered nothing, but hurried on like one
      distracted. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s mad,&rsquo; said Carl within himself&mdash;&lsquo;quite mad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They came together to their chambers, and Christopher sank into an
      arm-chair and moaned, unconscious of Carl&rsquo;s presence, &lsquo;Barbara! Barbara!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is madness,&rsquo; said Carl, tossing his hands tempestuously towards the
      ceiling, &lsquo;mere midsummer madness. Poor fellow! Stretton! Stretton! Listen
      to me! What is it? Don&rsquo;t you know me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For Christopher glared at him like one who had no knowledge of him, and
      then again hid his face within his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What on earth made you play that tune?&rsquo; cried Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She was there, man! She was there!&rsquo; groaned Christopher, rising and
      pacing the room with unequal steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who was there?&rsquo; said Carl, almost as wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Barbara,&rsquo; groaned Christopher again, &lsquo;Mademoiselle Hélène is Barbara
      Allen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Angels and ministers of grace defend us!&rdquo;&rsquo; murmured the theatrical Carl.
      &lsquo;I must humour him. Never mind, old man. Suppose she is! what does it
      matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Carl! Carl!&rsquo; cried the other, turning upon him and gripping him by
      both shoulders. &lsquo;I never loved another woman, and I never can. I would
      have built my hopes of Heaven upon her truth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl began to think there was something in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean that Mademoiselle Hélène is Miss Allen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I said so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that you knew her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We were sweethearts when we were children. We were engaged to be married
      two years ago. Would you believe it, Carl? would you believe it? I had a
      letter from her only this morning dated from the old place in the country.
      Think of the cunning perfidy of it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long can she have known Holt?&rsquo; asked Carl, rather to himself than
      Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, how can I tell?&rsquo; said the musician, groaning. &lsquo;She has deceived me
      all along.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no present consolation possible, and Carl had the sense to see
      it. He lit a pipe and watched his unhappy friend sympathetically.
      Christopher went up and down the room exclaiming here and there against
      the perfidy of woman. There came an imperious summons at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let him in, whoever it is,&rsquo; said Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody kicked the door and roared &lsquo;Rubach!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Milford,&rsquo; said Carl; &lsquo;the manager. There&rsquo;s going to be a row. A bit
      of a row will do you good, my poor fellow. I shall let him in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So said, so done. Enter Milford the lordly, in a towering rage, followed
      by Holt, evidently disposed to appease his manager&rsquo;s wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have called,&rsquo; said the manager, blowing hard and fixing a savage eye on
      Carl, &lsquo;to know what the devil you mean, sir, by turning the theatre into a
      bear-garden?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My good sir&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; said Carl with Continental affability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t &ldquo;good sir&rdquo; me, sir,&rsquo; cried the manager. &lsquo;What the devil do you
      mean, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is a matter for commiseration, sir, not for anger,&rsquo; Carl began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the great man began to swear, and did it well and fluently, with
      gusto. When he had done, he collected himself and shook his fist at Carl
      with a final admonition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you come near my theatre again, you&mdash;you foreign rascal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is I who am to blame,&rsquo; said Christopher, &lsquo;and not he. It was I who
      played for him, and who&mdash;in short, I am to blame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager glared speechlessly for a moment, and then gasped,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Explain, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Rubach,&rsquo; said Christopher, &lsquo;had sprained his wrist by a fall this
      evening. He came to me and requested me to play for him behind the scenes
      in the last act. You know what happened. <i>That</i> I cannot explain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation was awkward for everybody. If Barbara&rsquo;s perfidy had sullied
      his own life and left him desolate, Christopher could still speak no evil
      of her in the presence of the man for whom she had jilted him. Carl&rsquo;s
      tongue was tied by his regard for Holt&rsquo;s feelings. The manager naturally
      wanted to get at the bottom of the situation, and the dramatist felt that
      a friend whom he was learning to value had somehow imperilled his play.
      All four stood silent, and footsteps came leisurely up the stone stairs,
      and were heard very distinctly in the stillness. The door had been left
      open, but one of the new-comers stopped to tap at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; cried Carl, ready to welcome any diversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A red face and a grey head came round the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does Mr. Stretton&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;? Oh! Chris, my boy, how are you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No other a person than Barbara&rsquo;s uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve brought Barbara to see you. Come in, Barbara. Why, what&rsquo;s the
      matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher turned away from Barbara, as she approached him, veiled, and
      walked to the window, through which he looked on the night, seeing
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chris!&rsquo; said Barbara, in a pathetic, wounded voice. &lsquo;Chris!&rsquo; Mechanically
      she raised her veil and looked round upon her uncle with a pale scared
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stretton!&rsquo; roared Carl, leaping at him and laying forcible hands upon
      him, forgetful of his own sprained wrist. &lsquo;Is this Miss Allen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Christopher, with a sob which would have way in spite of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then it isn&rsquo;t Mademoiselle Hélène,&rsquo; said Carl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher turned with bewildered looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me,&rsquo; he said to Barbara wildly, &lsquo;are you playing at the Garrick
      Theatre?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been a-drinking, Christopher,&rsquo; said Barbara&rsquo;s uncle plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Barbara, frightened as she well might be at the presence of
      strangers at this curious scene, and at the scene itself. &lsquo;Uncle had
      business in London, and he brought me with him this afternoon. We heard
      that you had written the music to a play, and we went to hear it. We&mdash;we
      thought you would be conducting, and that I should see you there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Barbara put up her hands and began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Carl to the manager, &lsquo;I ask you, as the first step towards the
      understanding of this business, to admit that the likeness between this
      young lady and Mademoiselle Hélène is very remarkable and close.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very remarkable!&rsquo; said the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wonderful!&rsquo; said Mr. Holt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Me and my niece have been a-laughing at it and a-noticing of it all the
      evening,&rsquo; said Barbara&rsquo;s uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl told the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have it in the papers,&rsquo; said Milford the manager. &lsquo;Stunning good
      advertisement; Eh? No names, of course. Oh dear, no; no names!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the manager and the dramatist suddenly felt themselves de trop, and
      Carl, catching the infection, went with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you forgive me for doubting you?&rsquo; said Christopher. &lsquo;It was I who
      suffered by it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Chris!&rsquo; said Barbara, and quite regardless of her uncle she put her
      arms round her lover&rsquo;s neck and kissed him like the tenderhearted,
      unsophisticated child she was. &lsquo;Am I cruel Barbara now?&rsquo; she asked,
      nestling to him, and looking up with a smile half audacious, half
      appealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Christopher a little sheepishly. But as she slipped away from
      him he recovered himself and took her in his arms and kissed her tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, shortly thereafter&mdash;to finish in the style of the best of all
      story-tellers who entertained us in our childhood&mdash;they married, and
      lived happily.
